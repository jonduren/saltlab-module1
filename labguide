This lab will focus on installation and setup of salt on a pair of OpenSUSE systems.  
Goals for this lab include:
  Install and configure the salt-master
  Install and configure the salt-minion
  Accept the minion keys on the master
  Test connectivity with the minion
  Execute basic commands on the minion
  Learn how to target minions
  Use the salt built-in documentation to learn about modules and functions

Module 1: - Basic SALT installation, setup and verification and executing commands remotely

Install and Setup Salt Master
  Configure salt-master to auto-start with the machine
  Add a respository and install the latest SALT
  Open the firewall for the Master ports
  Talk about why it’s not a good idea to manage your master as a minion

Install and Setup Salt Minions
  Process for a GUI/Desktop installation
  Process for a Server/CLI installation
    Sudo yast2
    Set hostname, domain name
    Set hostname via DHCP = NO
    Set dns, domain-search
    Set domain-search
    Systemctl restart network
    Ip addr
    Ip route
  Add repository and refresh (yast2 commands)
    Install salt-minion (yast2 commands)
  Edit /etc/salt/minion file to add master
    NOTE: with a salt dns name this is not required
    Sudo vim /etc/salt/minion
  Set salt-minion to auto-start with machine
    Sudo Systemctl enable salt-minion
  (No firewall changes needed)
  Sudo reboot

Return to the Master Server
  Accept Keys from Minions
    Salt-key -L
    Salt-key -A
    Salt-key -L
    List the Keys
  Test Connectivity
    Salt ‘*’ test.ping
  Check the version of the minion
    Salt ‘*’ test.version (should be 2019.2.0)
  Understand the directory structure for Salt
    On SUSE /srv/salt
  Run commands remotely
    Salt ‘*’ cmd.run ‘cat /proc/cpuinfo/’
    Salt ‘*’ cmd.run ‘cat /etc/
    Salt ‘*’ cmd.run ‘cat /etc/os-release’
    Salt ‘*’ timezone.get_zone
  Discussion topic – why the . in some commands and underscore in others
  Targeting a specific minion vs using globs. 
  Using salt to get documentation for commands and modules
    Salt ‘*’ sys.doc sys
    Salt ‘*’ sys.doc test
    For a much more in depth look at the various modules and functions see the documentation at saltstack.com
  Let’s reboot the minion
    Salt ‘minion1’ system.reboot
  Before leaving module (1) we are going to have a little fun. 
    Post a message to slack
      salt ‘minion1’ slack.post_message api=??? channel=’testchannel’ message=”This is a test” from=’Whomever you want to post as” 

You have now completed module one.
Feel free to continue testing commands against minion1.
